# Divvy-Bikeshare-Analysis
Increasing membership subscriptions using trip data from 2023

## Introduction
This analysis will examine a scenario posed by a fictional bikeshare company operating out of Chicago. The company, Cyclistic, allows customers to use one of 5824 bicycles to travel between one of 692 stations scattered around Chicago. There are three pricing options: single-use passes, daily-use passes, and annual memberships. Given that nnual memberships comprise the majority of Cyclistic's profits, this analysis will explore the differences between single-use and daily-use riders (refered to as casual riders) versus riders with annual memberships (referred to as members) - and determine how to convert casual riders to members. 

### The Business Task
  * How do casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently from members? 
  * What actions can be taken to encourage casual riders to subscribe to an annual membership?

### Data Source
